# BallLauncher
Ball Launcher Project 
This project is an educational personal project between Juan and I.

I will primarily be using Github to upload changes that will be made to the firmware/code as well as electrical design.

Initial design:
-
1) STM NUCLEO-F411RE Dev Board
2) RS-775 BDC Motors
3) NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
4) Design H-Bridge Driver using KiCAD
